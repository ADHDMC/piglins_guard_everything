# Piglins Guard EVERYTHING

Welcome to "Piglins guard EVERYTHING" -

With this datapack installed, you'll be in for a wild ride as piglins will now guard every block in the game, from diamonds to dirt!

That's right, no more easy mining or casual exploration - you'll have to fight off a hoard of angry piglins just to get your hands on some netherrack! And don't think you can just avoid them by sticking to the warped forests, because this datapack also removes the piglins' fear of certain blocks. That means you'll have to be on guard no matter where you go in the nether.

So if you're looking for a challenge in your Minecraft game, "Piglins guard EVERYTHING" is the datapack for you. Just don't say we didn't warn you when you're knee-deep in bacon bits and wishing you had stuck to mining in the overworld!
